How is the blockchain voting app different from the regular voting app.
first consider the regular voting app
here as soon as the user selects a candidate the candiates count variable gets updated. This is vunarable because if someone has hacked into the system and the vote variable is misused the polling can be rigged.

The blockchain voting app is made such that each of the vote is treated as an entry in the ledger as soon as the voting process is completed the number of transactions related to a partiular candidate is counted. That is the public key of voter and the public key of candidate is used and the money or the entity which is transacted is VOTE!.

Step 3 : interacting with the contract via the nodejs console
